This project is a Streamlit-based Food Donation Management System that connects food providers and receivers to reduce food wastage by enabling seamless donations. Users can filter donations by location, provider, food type, and meal type, and directly contact providers or receivers through the platform. The app supports full CRUD operations (adding, updating, and deleting records) and is powered by Python, Streamlit, Pandas, and SQLite/CSV for storage. It provides an easy-to-use interface for managing food donations efficiently while promoting social good. The project includes installation instructions, usage guide, and scope for future enhancements such as authentication, notifications, and map integration.
